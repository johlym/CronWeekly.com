## Why?

If you're a subscriber, you may wonder _why_ there should be advertising. The top reasons are:

* Sending the newsletter costs money (Mailchimp)
* Writing the newsletter takes time and effort (not just to write, but during the week to gather all the links)

There is, to me, one ground rule: advertising should be transparent and actually add value. No online casino's, dating sites or viagra. Content that would actually appeal to a subscriber.

## Why advertise?

If you're currently running AdSense or other ads, you know clickthrough and read-rates are terrible. AdBlockers cause your advertisements to be missed by 50% or more of your target audience.

Those AdBlockers don't work in newsletters: we link based on textual links and paragraphs of texts, things an AdBlocker can't detect and block.

If your link is included in the newsletter, you can be sure that everyone who opened it has read your message.

Some numbers:
* 1700 subscribers (as of 15/06/2016)
* 60% confirmed open rate (in reality this is probably 80-85% as the audience is tech-savvy enough to block the tracking pixels)

For targetted advertising, newsletters make a lot more sense than AdSense, DoubleClick, Facebook or Twitter.

## How to start advertising?

This is an open source focusssed newsletter, so you can open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/mattiasgeniar/CronWeekly.com/issues) and fill in the template.

Every part of the communication is held in the open, for everyone to review. I believe if the code and projects we adore are open source, so should the finances of this newsletter.
